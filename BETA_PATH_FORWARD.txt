                                  ↓
                    1. Run 8 tests from TESTING_READY.md
                                  ↓
                            🟡 DOCUMENT RESULTS

================================================================================
                         QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
================================================================================

Q: Do I run the tests manually or are they automated?
A: Manual for now. Follow the steps in TESTING_READY.md using the browser.
   No special test framework needed - just use the app.

Q: What if Test 3 fails (AI suggestions)?
A: That's OK for beta. It's marked as "Coming Soon" anyway.
   The important part is that it doesn't crash.

Q: How long does testing take?
A: About 1-1.5 hours if you run all 8 tests.
   30-45 minutes if you run them quickly.

Q: What do I do if a test fails?
A: Document it, note the exact error, and we'll fix it.
   Usually takes < 1 hour to diagnose and fix.

Q: Can we skip staging and go straight to production?
A: Not recommended. Staging is where we catch config issues
   (API keys, database, environment variables, etc).

Q: How many beta testers do we need?
A: 10-15 is ideal. Mix of:
   - 4-5 creators (people with ideas)
   - 4-5 collaborators (experts, advisors)
   - 2-3 power users (stress testers)

Q: What's the rollback plan?
A: If production breaks, we can rollback in 15 minutes.
   Feature flags let us disable problematic features instantly.

================================================================================
                         READY TO EXECUTE?
================================================================================

Next step: Open TESTING_READY.md and start Test 1.

Time commitment: 1-2 hours for testing + fixes
Expected outcome: Confirmed that all features work
Blocking issue? No - we have 3-week timeline to address

Let's bring VentureLab to beta! 🚀
