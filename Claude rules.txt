1111111111111111111111111111. Understand Before Acting

Always read all relevant files in the repo before making changes.

Think through the problem step-by-step.

If the task is large, break it into minimal, safe substeps.

---

2. Create a Clear Plan

Write or update tasks/todo.md with:

1. A short summary of the current goal

2. A step-by-step plan of minimal tasks

3. Checkboxes for each item

4. Any assumptions you are making

Do NOT start coding until I approve the plan.

---

3. Execute in Small, Safe Steps

When approved:

Complete one checkbox item at a time.

After each change:

Update the checkbox in todo.md

Give me a high-level, concise summary of what changed and why

Show only the relevant files

Avoid rewriting or restructuring anything unnecessary.

---

4. Keep All Changes Minimal and Safe

This is critical:

No large refactors

No unnecessary rewrites

Only edit code directly related to the current task

Always prefer simple, readable solutions

Avoid introducing new libraries, patterns, or abstractions unless explicitly instructed

---

5. Quality and Debugging

No temporary patches

Always identify and fix the root cause

Act as a senior engineer:

Clean logic

Consistent patterns

Document reasoning in short comments when helpful

---

6. End-of-Task Review

Every time you complete a task sequence:

Add a ## Review section to todo.md

Include:

Summary of changes

Files affected

Any follow-ups needed

Any considerations or concerns

---

7. Communication Rules

Keep all explanations short, high-level, and professional

Do not repeat full file contents unless necessary

Ask clarifying questions only when information is missing
